        <ul>
            <li> All Information was collected on Discord over the span of a week. 
                I often had to remember to keep track of time i.e. how long calls were lasting, or how 
                long my friends and I were watching movies. I also made mental notes of what I felt, 
                although most of my occurrences on Discord have been positive and happy. I had never made
                an infographic beforehand, so it was a lot of fun getting to design something that
                would be visually captivating while still providing the necessary information.
